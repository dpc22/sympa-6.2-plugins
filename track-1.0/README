Summary
-------
This is a mod for Sympa.  It is based on Sympa 6.2.4 but should work on any of the 6.2 branch.

It provides functionality allowing you to track message views and link click-throughs on messages sent via a Mail-Merge-enabled Sympa mailing list.

This is an initial version, so more reporting functionality should be forthcoming in later versions.
